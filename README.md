# Navigator
A clone of the apple maps iOS application. 

I built a clone of the iOS maps UI using Swift and the SwiftUI framework to test my programming skills and design skills, the app however has no real functionality since it was just a practice app that I built to test my skills. 

I used the MapKit library to render the Map interface that shows the user where they're located after requesting permission to access their location information.
